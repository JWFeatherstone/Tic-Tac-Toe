# Tic-Tac-Toe
## Abstract:
This is a web application allowing users to play Tic-Tac-Toe, a classic, simple strategy game. Players take in turns to place their markers within the game board grid and the winner is whichever player manages to achieve three of their markers in a row - either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Installation Instructions:
Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
In your forked GitHub repository, click the code drop-down menu and copy the SSH key.
### Option 1
1. Open the terminal on your machine and navigate to the containing directory you’d like - to clone the repository folder and its contents to.
1. On the command line, run “git clone” + the SSH key you copied earlier.
1. A new folder will be created containing a local copy of the repository linked to the forked repository you created - enter the new directory.
1. On the command line, run “open index.html”.
### Option 2
1. In the forked repository you created, open the “Settings” tab and select “Pages” on the left pane.
1. Under “Build and Deployment”, select “Deploy from a Branch” within the “Source” drop-down menu.
1. Under “Branch”, select the “main” branch in the drop-down menu and hit the “Save” button.
1. On the right-hand side of the main page of your repository, find the “Environments” section and click the link for “github-pages” - this may take some time to load at first.
1. In the following page, hit the “View Deployment” button to view the site.

## Context:
- This project was completed as part of the Final Solo Challenge of module one for the [Turing School of Software and Design Front End Web Development program](https://frontend.turing.edu/), a four module, seven month focused on preparing students for a career as web developers working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework.
- This project was completed over the course of a week, in line with the [Project Specification and Rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/tic-tac-toe-solo-v2.html).
- The intent of the assignment is to demonstrate and evaluate students' competency in combining the fundamentals of Javascript, HTML, and CSS learned throughout Mod 1 to build a web application that utilizes clean and efficient Javascript, establishes a distinct data model and DOM and uses the former to update the latter, and that pushes students to apply and develop problem solving skills to break down larger problems.

## Learning Goals:
- My primary learning goal for this project centered on refactoring code and building codebases that are more easily read, maintained, and modified.
    - For this purpose, I allotted more time in the schedule than previous projects to revisiting the code post-buildout and intentionally limited the scope of the project and its features.
    - My hope was that in doing so, and in being deliberate in establishing a workflow and process for revisiting and building code, I would begin to strengthen beneficial habits and best practices - e.g. implementing consistent naming conventions and formatting, establishing the data model as the single source of truth for the website - and further understand how the code I'm writing works together and can be structured to be more modular.
- I was also keen to further build a discipline of incorporating feedback and lessons learned from past projects - in this instance, integrating adaptive design for smaller screen sizes and being mindful of where functions can be either broken out, simplified, or combined.

## Wins + Challenges:
- My biggest challenge with this project definitely came through the refactoring process. Often, modifying past code would have cascading effects that I couldn't always anticipate and this was initially quite time intensive to debug. 

- In allowing myself more time to refactor and in experiencing the challenges I did in initially undertaking that process, I feel that I have a better understanding of how a project can be built from the ground up to anticipate future change and to allow individual components to be as modular as possible. Taking the time to incorporate simple - but impactful - disciplines into my workflow and to planning out a consistent, flexible overall approach (e.g. "this is how I'll name container classes", "this is how I'll accomodate CSS and JS class hooks", "this is my anticipated flow of events") should save both myself and my future coworkers time and effort moving forward.
